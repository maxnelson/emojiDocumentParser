JSON version of the official emoji list published by Unicode.

Generated from [emoji-test.txt](https://unicode.org/Public/emoji/latest/emoji-test.txt) with
[this script](parse_emojis.js).

### Details

Unicode publishes an official document containing all emojis. This document can be found here:

https://www.unicode.org/Public/emoji/16.0/emoji-test.txt

This is a very basic script that parses that document and formats it into the more useable JSON
format.

Should be handy if you're building something like an emoji picker.
