### TLDR;

JSON version of the official emoji list published by Unicode.

### Details

Unicode publishes an official document containing all emojis. This document can be found here:

https://www.unicode.org/Public/emoji/16.0/emoji-test.txt

This is a very basic script that parses that document and formats it into the more useable JSON
format.

Should be handy if you're building something like an emoji picker.
